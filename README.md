> [!WARNING]  
> We are in the process of modernizing ADOL-C. The master branch is unstable. Please use the latest release!


This new version of ADOL-C features new library functions for
 
  - sparse Jacobians and sparse Hessians
  - external differentiated functions
  - optimal checkpointing
  - adapted differentiation of fixed point iterations
  - parallel differentiation of OpenMP-parallel loops
  - Lie derivatives of scalar, vector and covector fields

and many bug fixes.

Furthermore the source code was adapted to allow a compilation with
WINDOWS compilers. See file `ÃŒNSTALL` for generic installation
instructions and special instructions for the installation on a WINDOWS
platform.

The complete documentation can be found in the subdirectory "doc".


## Local installation using CMake

1. Create a build directory somewhere, and move into that directory

2. Call CMake:

     `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/you/want/to/install/in path/to/adolc/sources`

3. Build and install:

     `make`  
     `make install`  



## Local installation using the AutoTools

1. Type `autoreconf -fi`

2. Run configure with possibly using one of these options:

    `--prefix=PREFIX`           install library and header files in PREFIX
                              (default: `${HOME}/adolc_base`)  
 
    `--enable-sparse`           build sparse drivers [default=no]  

    `--with-openmp-flag=FLAG`   use FLAG to enable OpenMP at compile time
                              [default=none]  

    `--enable-docexa`           build documented examples [default=no]  
    `--enable-addexa`           build additional examples [default=no]  
    `--enable-parexa`           build parallel example [default=no], if yes
                              `-with-openmp-flag=FLAG` required  

    `--with-cflags=FLAGS`       use `CFLAGS=FLAGS` (default=`-g -02`)  
    `--with-cxxflags=FLAGS`     use `CXXFLAGS=FLAGS` (default=`-g -02 -std=c++11`)  

    `--with-boost=BOOST_PATH`   path to the compiled boost library, otherwise
                              the system one is chosen by default (if exists)  

3. Type `make`

4. Type `make install`

   By default, `make install` will install all the files in `${PREFIX}/lib` and
   `${PREFIX}/include`. You can specify another installation directory by using
   the `--prefix-option` in the configure call.

This procedure provides all makefiles required in the appropriate directories.
Execute `configure --help` for more details on other available option.



## Nonlocal installation

As mentioned in INSTALL one can configure the adolc package to be installed
in a different directory than `${HOME}/adolc_base` by using the `--prefix=PATH`
configure option. This is typically used for global installations. Common PATHs
are `/usr` and `/usr/local/`, and others are known to be used. Fine control
over the installation directories can be gained by supplying additional
configure options. See `./configure --help` for details.

Completing the installation by executing `make install` requires write
permissions for all target directories. Make sure to have them or the result
may be surprising otherwise.

A global installation can be helpful if many users need the library. By adding
the library's path to `/etc/ld.so.conf` the usage of `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and the
`-L` link switch becomes unnecessary. In many cases, for instance for
`PATH=/usr/local`, the use of the `-I` directive for compiling sources becomes
unnecessary too.



## Examples

Examples must be configured to build by using the configure switches
   `--enable-docexa` or `--enable-addexa`.
They will never be installed by make install but can be found in the
appropriate example subdirectory.


## Windows Compilation with MINGW

Please refer to `INSTALL`

## Windows Compilation with Visual Studio

Please refer to the file `MSMSVisualStudio/v14/Readme_VC++.txt` for building the library and
`ADOL-C/examples/Readme_VC++.txt` for the documented examples.



## Unit tests

ADOL-C provides more than 500 unit tests to verify its basic functionality including both traceless and trace-based adouble variants. The tests are based on BOOST (version >= 1.59.0). Building the ADOL-C teste requires the BOOST libraries `unit_test_framework` and `system`. In case you are compiling BOOST on your own, be sure to add the flags `--with-test` and `--with-system` to activate the corresponding modules.  
You can build and run them as follows:  
`mkdir build && cd build`  
`cmake -S .. -B . -DBUILD_TESTS=ON`  
`make`  
`./ADOL-C/boost-test/boost-test-adolc`  

Cmake will search for the system installed version of BOOST. If the minimum required version is not satisfied, please enter the path where an appropriate BOOST version is installed in `3RDPARTY_BOOST_DIR` in the `CMakelists.txt` inside the `boost-test` folder. Notice that ADOL-C has to be compiled with the same version of BOOST as used here. When using a different BOOST version than the one provided by the operating system, ADOL-C can be configured with `--with-boost` flag before compiling the ADOL-C sources.


Enjoy this new version!
